This is a guideline for the template creation gig. This include instructions and skeleton of the creation process, please read through accordingly.

## Disclaimers

You will need to make sure all resources from your template are created by your own, and Magic Mirror has the rights to redistribute your work freely or paid.

## The Skeleton Template

<div class="center" markdown="1">
[![](/images/download-sketch.png)]({{ site.downloadurl }}/template-gig)
</div>

After you download the file, you should be seeing Page 1 with a number of artboards.

![](/images/skeleton-page1.png)

1. The left side are the devices artboards, they’re are meant to be a starting point for your template, and meant to be mirrored to your artboard. You can remove the unnecessary ones.
2. The “Main” artboard is where your design should go, start drawing shapes and putting photos there. You can change the resolution to whatever make sense for the template.

Page 2 of the sketch file, is meant for the template’s preview image as well as an overall style guide:

![](/images/skeleton-page2.png)

1. The “Apple Device Names” artboard are stamps you can put on the preview image.
2. The “Styles” artboard is a container for overall template styles and reference for the font size.
3. The “hero” artboard is designed to be your canvas for a social optimized preview of the template. The website referenced Facebook’s best practice for a 1200 x 630 resolution layout.

Here’s the example on how an actual template might look like:

## Checklist

Before you submit your template, please make sure you have the following list checked.
