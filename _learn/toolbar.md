Use "Ctrl-Shift-M" shortcut to quickly launch the toolbar, or access it [through the menu](/learn/keyboard-shortcuts).

When nothing is selected.


### 1) Pick an Artboard to Perspective Transform

Select any 4-point shape, then pick an artboard from the selector combobox to apply perspective transform.


### 2) Rotate Content

You can rotate the image inside without affecting the shape's geometry.

 
### 3) Flip Content

Flipping the content can be useful, for example when you're working on [reflections](https://medium.com/perspective-design-in-sketch/perspective-mockups-in-sketch-reflections-5fa275ce947).


### 4) Jump to Artboard

"Jump to Artboard" helps you locate the artboard so that you can quickly edit the content, it works even when your artboard is in a different page.


### 5) Image Quality Selection

@1x and @2x depends on the source of the artboard size, so the higher the source is, the clearer the rendered image. It's fast and works well with general UI perpective transform.
Max resolution depends on the target shape's size and creates a 3x more enhanced version of the image, it's generally slower but produce the best quality image.
