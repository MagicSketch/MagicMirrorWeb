# Trobleshoot

**I keep getting "incorrect" response when I enter the license?**

**ans:** First, try to download a [pro template](/templates/donors-gift/), if it doesn't work, there are probably issues on my server. Please contact me through [email](james@magicmirror.design).

**Okay, the pro user templates works, what now?**

**ans:** It indicates that your computer might have connected to a network with some sort of firewall blocking internet access to http://api.magicmirror.design, please contact your network adminstrator to whitelist it.  

If there's no way you can get it sorted, try using personal hotspot in your mobile phone, celluar network providers are usually less defensive.
