Sketch has just announced version 3.4! And there's a few API changes, and there you go with Magic Mirror v1.2!

[Download v1.2.1]({{ site.downloadurl }}/latest)

<sub>The API adoption in v1.2.1 is not compatible with Sketch 3.3.3, so if you need previous version you can get it here [v1.2]({{ site.downloadurl }}/v1_2)</sub>
