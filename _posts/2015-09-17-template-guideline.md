There are still very few resources out there regarding “perspective mockups for Sketch”, the community appreciates every bits of contributions to create more resources available.

Magic Mirror [Templates](/templates) section provides a few examples on how you might create Sketch templates. From the examples I have noticed a few boilerplate and manual work before we have a proper environment for working with Magic Mirror Templates.

Thats why I’m creating this skeleton template.

## The Skeleton Template

<div class="center" markdown="1">
[![](/images/download-sketch.png)]()
</div>

After you download the file, you should be seeing Page 1 with a number of artboards.

![](/images/skeleton-page1.png)

1. The left side are the devices artboards, they’re are meant to be a starting point for your template, and meant to be mirrored to your artboard. You can remove the unnecessary ones.
2. The “Main” artboard is where your design should go, start drawing shapes and putting photos there. You can change the resolution to whatever make sense for the template.

Page 2 of the sketch file, is meant for the template’s preview image as well as an overall style guide:

![](/images/skeleton-page2.png)

1. The “Apple Device Names” artboard are stamps you can put on the preview image.
2. The “Styles” artboard is a container for overall template styles and reference for the font size.
3. The “hero” artboard is designed to be your canvas for a social optimized preview of the template. The website referenced Facebook’s best practice for a 1200 x 630 resolution layout.

Here’s the example on how an actual template might look like:

![](/images/skeleton-example-page1.png)
![](/images/skeleton-example-page2.png)

## Checklist

Before you submit your template, please make sure you have the following list checked.

![](/images/skeleton-requirement.png)

1. Your template should include the “Shape” that’s properly sized according to the screen edges, and renamed according to your “Device” artboard.
2. Your template can consist one or more artboards.
3. You should delete artboards that’s not necessary in Page 1
4. You should also create a preview image and put it inside the “hero” artboard in page two without changing the resolution of the “hero” artboard.

## Submission

So if you’re good and would like to share the freebie, please include the attached sketch file with a few info, and send an email to [james@magicmirror.design](mailto:james@magicmirror.design) with following format. (Replace text wrapped in the <brackets>)

## Disclaimers & Regulations

In the email, you should attach this one liner acknowledgement:

```
I agreed all parts in the template are created by my own, and Magic Mirror for Sketch has the rights to redistribute my work only through the site without a price tag.
```

## Paid Template?

By default your submission will consider to be a free resource to the community, tho Magic Mirror will have the rights to put it in either the "Free" or "Members" section.

We don't have any automated payment mechanism right now, because the site is currently really a static page built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). While the lack of ecommerce mechanism in the site, I'm still open if you have ideas on how a revenue splitting model or affilliate programs could work out for us.

## Additional Resources

Magic Mirror [Templates](http://magicmirror.design/templates) section provides a few examples on how you might create Sketch templates. You may reference from it but you should not include resources in other templates inside yours.
